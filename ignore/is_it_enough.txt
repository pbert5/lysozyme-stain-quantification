is it sufficient for  a methods paper on its own

Thought for 16s

Short answer: yes—for a Methods/Applications Note, if you wrap it in solid validation. For a full methods paper in a stronger venue, you’ll likely need one or two extra contributions (auto-parameterization and broader generalization) plus rigorous benchmarking.

Why it’s publishable as a methods note

Clear algorithmic idea: dual logical masks (R>B for crypts, B>2R for non-crypt) → marker-controlled watershed with per-component seeds → domain-aware scoring.

Interpretable + lightweight: no training data required; decisions map to biology.

Nontrivial engineering: careful seed crafting prevents over-merge; multi-feature ranking.

What you must include to make it “sufficient”

Ground truth & data: n slides/animals/fields, pixel size, staining/scan variability; dual annotators; inter-rater agreement.

Baselines:

Classical: Otsu/triangle + morphology; vanilla watershed; QuPath-style tissue/seed.

Learning: 1–2 light baselines (Cellpose/StarDist or a small U-Net) for context.

Metrics: Dice/IoU, Precision/Recall/F1, boundary (ASSD/Hausdorff-95), instance metrics (AP@IoU, PQ), count correlation; Bland–Altman for area.

Ablations: remove per-component markers; fixed vs scale-aware dilation; your elevation vs gradient; with/without scoring; with/without simple normalization.

Robustness: sensitivity to threshold multipliers, blur, illumination, SNR; cross-slide generalization.

Reproducibility: code + configs (YAML), seed control, versions, CLI, runtime & memory; small demo dataset.

Minimal upgrades that raise it toward a full methods paper

Auto-normalization: work on a ratio image (e.g., R/(B+ε) or log-ratio) with percentile scaling; compute thresholds from data (Otsu/mixture on ratio).

Scale-aware morphology: derive kernel radii from pixel size; prefer geodesic dilation within a tissue mask.

Elevation strengthening: gradient-based surface + h-minima to kill spurious basins.

Feature standardization: z-score features before applying your weights; optionally learn weights on a small labeled set (keeps it “weakly learned” but still lightweight).

Generalization test: replicate on a second dataset (different lab/stain or imaging conditions).

Bottom line

As written: strong Methods/Applications Note material, provided you supply baselines, ablations, and reproducibility.

To reach “full methods” in a higher-impact venue, add auto-normalization + scale-aware morphology + stronger elevation and demonstrate cross-dataset generalization with thorough stats.
